🚀 CodeAlpha Frontend Development Internship

This repository contains the tasks completed as part of my Frontend Development Internship at CodeAlpha. The internship focused on building practical projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance frontend development skills.

📌 Internship Overview

The CodeAlpha internship program provides hands-on experience in frontend technologies. During this internship, I worked on real-world projects that strengthened my knowledge of:

HTML5 & Semantic Structure CSS3 (Responsive Design, Animations, Transitions) JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Events, Functions) Git & GitHub for version control Deploying websites on GitHub Pages / Netlify

✅ Internship Tasks I successfully completed the following tasks from the given list :

Task 2: Calculator

This project is a responsive and interactive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my CodeAlpha Frontend Development Internship.
It performs all basic arithmetic operations and has an attractive modern UI.

🧮 Features

Performs Addition (+), Subtraction (−), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).
Real-time input display: updates instantly as the user types.
Keyboard support: users can enter numbers and operators using keyboard keys.
Clear (C) and Delete (⌫) buttons for better control.
Responsive design that works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Hover and click animations for an enhanced user experience.

💻 Technologies Used

HTML5 — for structure of the calculator layout.
CSS3 — for styling, button design, shadows, hover animations, and responsiveness.
JavaScript (ES6) — for all calculation logic, button click handling, and keyboard input.

🚀 How It Works

Each button click or keyboard keypress is captured using JavaScript event listeners.
The expression is displayed in the input area in real time.
When the user clicks =, the expression is evaluated using a custom function (not eval() for safety).
The result is then displayed instantly on the screen.
Any invalid input shows an “Error” message to handle exceptions safely.

📱 Responsive Design

The calculator layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.
Buttons resize and rearrange to fit both small and large displays seamlessly.

🎨 UI Highlights

Modern dark theme with gradient buttons.
Smooth hover and press animations using CSS transitions.
Real-time feedback for every button press.
